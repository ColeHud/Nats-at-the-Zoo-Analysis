UTR “A Disaster For Player Development”
And How To Fix It!

Watching players pull out at Kalamazoo after a main draw loss is like nails on a chalkboard to junior development coaches. Players, parents and some coaches manipulate rankings by avoiding matches advocating pullouts after a tough match or to maintain the strength of their 30 match record. This is now happing across all age groups As shown here in National 14’s, USTA has not helped the situation by adding to the value that college coaches are putting on these ratings by using them to help seed major national and sectional events. For some National tournaments this is unofficial... but the kids and coaches have picked up on the reality of the situation.

The fact is that without controls... UTR is unintentionally bringing out the worst in our computer online driven culture. Gone are the tough it out situations that grow and develop character.

What’s sad is that it doesn’t have to be that way. As a leader in tennis you would think that the owners of UTR would feel a responsibility to grow and promote the best in our youth.

I call on them to: 
1. Establish set point deductions for every default of the last 30 matches on players records regardless of circumstance. 
2. Establish match minimums throughout the year. Sliding deductions as these are not met. 
3. Increased point factors that occur at the more important events. 
4. Matches are counted at full value on any retirement.

UTR- it’s time to accept some responsibility for the behaviors that you are driving. Help coaches teach players the right way to compete!
